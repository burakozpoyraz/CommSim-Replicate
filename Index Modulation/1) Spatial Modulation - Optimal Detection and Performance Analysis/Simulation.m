% Abstract: In this letter, we derive the optimal detector for the
% so-called spatial modulation (SM) system introduced by Mesleh et al. in
% [1]. The new detector performs significantly better than the original 
% (~4 dB gain), and we support our results by deriving a closed form
% expression for the average bit error probability. Performance gains
% (~1.5 - 3 dB) over popular multiple antenna systems, making it an
% excellent candidate for future wireless communication standards.
